help_text = """MockMeister is a desktop application that helps you generate random mock data for various purposes like testing or creating sample datasets. Here's a quick guide to get you started:

1. Choosing Data Fields:

On the left side, you'll find a list widget. This is where you select the data fields you want to generate.
Click the dropdown menu in the "Combo Box" section to see a list of available data fields (e.g., first name, last name, email, etc.).
Click the "+" button to add the selected field to the list widget.
You can add multiple fields by selecting them from the dropdown and clicking "+" repeatedly.
The "-" button allows you to remove unwanted fields from the list.

2. Specifying Number of Rows:

In the "Row count:" section, use the spin box to set the desired number of rows for your generated data.
The minimum value is 1, and the maximum is 100.

3. Generating Data:

Once you've chosen your data fields and row count, click the "Generate" button.
MockMeister will fetch random data from an online API and populate the table on the right side.
The table will have columns corresponding to the selected data fields and rows based on the specified count.

4. Saving and Loading Data:

Click the "Save" button (in the toolbar) to save the generated data to a CSV file on your computer.
The filename will include a timestamp for easy identification.
Click the "Open" button (in the toolbar) to load previously saved data from a CSV file.
MockMeister will display the loaded data in the table."""
